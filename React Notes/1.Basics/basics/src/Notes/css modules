the css files we define our globally applied to all components

now we can scope css files :
so that whichever styles we define in here could be imported and
assigned to elements in this component and wouldn't overwrite styles in other components or other parts
of the app even if we were to share the names of the css classes.

To handle everything through scoped css files and to do that, we  need to tweak the built
configuration of our project.

we're using these react scripts, that this is a package which
exposes the whole build workflow to us and we can't really add it to the configuration.

command which gives us access to the configuration though, eject. You can
run npm run eject to basically convert youreverything is managed
for me project into everything is managed for me but I can edit the configuration project.

Webpack is basically the build, the bundling tool which gets used, which applies
all kinds of transformations and optimizations on our files and bundles them together and as part of
this process, it also takes care about our css files.
webpack is able to parse this css import in our javascript file.
