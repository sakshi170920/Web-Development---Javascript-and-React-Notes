React is a Javascript library for building User Interfaces.
1. It being a js library works in user's browser - hence faster.
2. React is all about components , every web page is divided into components 
and it makes code more manageable.
3. React can be called as custom HTML templates.
4. Re-usable Components make the creation of web pages easier.


Single Page Applications :
1.we only get back one single HTML file from the server and we get back this file the 
first time the user visits everything is managed with JavaScript with React. The entire page consists
of components which are rendered and handled by JavaScript.
2. our page is built up with components and every component is a React
component. The entire page is also managed by a root React component which is exclusively under React's control.
3. only one  ReactDOM.render() call
Multi Page Applications :
1.we get back multiple HTML pages where each page has the
content for a given route.we might also use React, but only to create little widgets,
so to say; individually-contained components we dump into that page 
but the 'entire page' is not managed by React.
2.we also could split up our app into theoretical components, but actually a lot of the page is just normal 
HTML and CSS and some widgets are react components.
So, the entire page is not under React's control. The individual widgets don't know of each other's existence.
3.Multiple  ReactDOM.render() call for each widget.



More popular is Single Page Applications : because if you manage the entire page with JavaScript,
you never have to go back to the server and reload the page.
This is an amazing user experience because everything happens instantly.
